I had no basis to come up with my questions and the only thing I could go off on a was trying to think from first principles about, what are the bottle next to AGI, because clearly Ilya is working on them in some way part of this question involved thinking about RL scaling because everybody's asking how well our generalized and how we can make a generalized better as part of this. I was reading this paper that came out recently on RL scaling and it showed that actually the learning Corona. RL looks like a sigmoid. I found this very curious. Why should be a sigmoid where?

And I was thinking about how these two ideas are related. I had this vague idea that they should be connected, but I really didn't know how. I don't have a math background, so I couldn't really formalize it. But I wondered if Gemini through could help me out here. And so, it took a picture of my notebook. And I took the paper and I put them both in the context of Gemini 3, and I asked it to find the connection and thought a bunch. And then it realized that the correct way to model the information you gain from a single. Yes, or no outcome in RL is as the entropy of a random binary variable.

I copy pasted it into a Google collab notebook, and I was able to run this toy ml experiment and visualize its results without a single bug. It's interesting because the results look similar, but not identical to what we should have expected. And so, I downloaded this chart, and I put it into Gemini and asked it, what is going on here and came up with the hypothesis that I think is actually correct? Which is that we're capping, how much supervised learning can improve in the beginning, by having a fixed learning rate. And in fact, we should decrease the learning rate over time, it actually gives us an intuitive understanding, for why in practice, we have learning race schedule orders that decrease the learning rate over time.

The problem is that if you just transcribe a conversation, verbatim using speech to text model, it'll be full of all kinds of fits and starts and confusing phrasing. We mentioned this problem to label box and they asked if they could take a staff working with them on this is probably the reason that I'm most excited to recommend Label Box to people. It wasn't just oh hey tell us what kind of data you need and we'll go get it. They walked us through the entire process from helping us identify what kind of data we needed in the first place to assembling a team of expert aligners to generate it. Even after we got all the data back, Lee will box stayed involved. They helped us choose the right base model and set up Auto QA on the models output so they could tweak and refine it. And now we have a new transcriber tool that we can use for all our episodes moving forward. This is just one example of how believable box meet.",

I had no basis to come up with my questions and the only thing I could go off on a was trying to think from first principles about, what are the bottle next to AGI, because clearly Ilya is working on them in some way part of this question involved thinking about RL scaling because everybody's asking how well our generalized and how we can make a generalized better as part of this. I was reading this paper that came out recently on RL scaling and it showed that actually the learning Corona. RL looks like a sigmoid. I found this very curious. Why should be a sigmoid where? It learns very little for a long time. And then it quickly learns a lot. And then asked him totes. This is very different from the power law. You see in pre-training where the model learns",

And I was thinking about how these two ideas are related. I had this vague idea that they should be connected, but I really didn't know how. I don't have a math background, so I couldn't really formalize it. But I wondered if Gemini through could help me out here. And so, it took a picture of my notebook. And I took the paper and I put them both in the context of Gemini 3, and I asked it to find the connection and thought a bunch. And then it realized that the correct way to model the information you gain from a single. Yes, or no outcome in RL is as the entropy of a random binary variable. It made a graph, which showed how the bits you gain first sample in our all versus supervised learning skill. As a pass rating, increase is. And as soon as I saw the",

I copy pasted it into a Google collab notebook, and I was able to run this toy ml experiment and visualize its results without a single bug. It's interesting because the results look similar, but not identical to what we should have expected. And so, I downloaded this chart, and I put it into Gemini and asked it, what is going on here and came up with the hypothesis that I think is actually correct? Which is that we're capping, how much supervised learning can improve in the beginning, by having a fixed learning rate. And in fact, we should decrease the learning rate over time, it actually gives us an intuitive understanding, for why in practice, we have learning race schedule orders that decrease the learning rate over time.

They walked us through the entire process from helping us identify what kind of data we needed in the first place to assembling a team of expert aligners to generate it. Even after we got all the data back, Lee will box stayed involved. They helped us choose the right base model and set up Auto QA on the models output so they could tweak and refine it.

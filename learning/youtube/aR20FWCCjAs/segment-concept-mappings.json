I don't have a math background, so I couldn't really formalize it. But I wondered if Gemini through could help me out here. And so, it took a picture of my notebook. And I took the paper and I put them both in the context of Gemini 3, and I asked it to find the connection and thought a bunch. And then it realized that the correct way to model the information you gain from a single. Yes, or no outcome in RL is as the entropy of a random binary variable.

It's interesting because the results look similar, but not identical to what we should have expected.

They walked us through the entire process from helping us identify what kind of data we needed in the first place to assembling a team of expert aligners to generate it. Even after we got all the data back, Lee will box stayed involved. They helped us choose the right base model and set up Auto QA on the models output so they could tweak and refine it.
